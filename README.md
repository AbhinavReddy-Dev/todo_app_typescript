# todo_app_typescript

- This app was built following the tutorial on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBmrduvKl5w&t=171s) and [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/typescript-todo-list).
- I have used Parcel instead of Snowpack since its not maintained anymore and is not suggested for new projects.
- Parcel supports TypeScript out of the box and no need for seperate configuration files, however you can still ue tsconfig file for any customizations.
